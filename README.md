# **Maize Disease Detection Web Application**

## **Project Description**

This project is a web application designed to assist in identifying and managing maize leaf diseases through AI-driven predictions. The application is **dockerized** for easy deployment and provides the following features:

1. **Disease Prediction**  
   - Users can upload maize leaf images, and the system predicts the disease affecting the leaf using a pre-trained machine learning model.

2. **Model Retraining**  
   - Users can upload bulk data (ZIP files of categorized images) to retrain the existing model with their dataset. This ensures the model adapts to new data and remains accurate.

3. **Data Visualizations**  
   - A dedicated page displays various interactive visualizations based on the dataset, with key insights and interpretations.

4. **Model Download**  
   - Users can download the retrained model for their use.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Detailed metrics for both prediction and retraining processes are displayed.

6. **Performance Testing**  
   - A **flood request simulation** was conducted using **Locust software** to evaluate system performance under heavy load.

The application is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend, while the backend is developed with **FastAPI**. The machine learning pipeline was designed from scratch, including scaling and monitoring on a cloud platform.
